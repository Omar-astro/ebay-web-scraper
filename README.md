> 💡 This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

### ✅ Setup Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - selenium
  - requests
  - bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
  - serpapi
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - networkx

  - Pillow (PIL)
  - webbrowser (built-in)
  - os (built-in)

- Additional requirements:
  - Correct version of ChromeDriver installed
  - Stable internet connection for live scraping


### 🧪 Execution Steps
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook
2. Run each cell sequentially **before** running the GUI cell
3. For demo:
   - Input item name in the first cell
   - Run scraping, graph loading, and visualization steps
4. Finally, execute the GUI cell to launch the full app

## ⚠️ Notes & Tips

- Some windows and graphs may take time to load (especially heatmap & NetworkX)
- Download and place `world.jpg` in your folder for the heatmap to work:

- To reduce lag, avoid enabling full data loading unless needed
- Enable advanced data fetching by uncommenting marked sections in the GUI cell
- Use specific keywords (like `"glasses"`) for better scraping accuracy
